# Barbershop Checker
## This plugin checks adherence to Barbershop Harmony rules

### Functionality

- Automatically identify chords and write chord symbols above top staff (Like Ctrl+K in MuseScore).
- Recognize advanced Jazz chords as well as classic chords. E.g. C11(b9/b13), Bb7#5, F7(b9), as well as C, G7, Am etc.
- Works on entire score, or only on selected notes (if selection includes more than one chord).   

- Mark places where Tenor isn't highest voice or Bass isn't lowest. (Works only for standard BBS scores - written either in 2 staves X 2 voices each, or in 4 separate staves)

It does not check adherence to homophanic/homorhythmic equirements of barbershop
Not to be used to determine whether a song is contestable! Refer to official judge for professional verdict

### Usage Tips  
- Ctrl-Z will undo all changes at once. So go ahead, try different parameters, see what works best for you!
- If no notes are selected, the plugin will work on the entire score. Otherwise, it will work only on the selected notes (Also if partial staves are selected, please beware).
